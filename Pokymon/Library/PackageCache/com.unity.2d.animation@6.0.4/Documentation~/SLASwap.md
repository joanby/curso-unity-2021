# Swapping Sprite Library Assets
If [swapping each Sprite of an actor individually](CharacterParts.md) takes too much effort, you can instead swap the entire __Sprite Library Asset__ to another one containing alternate Sprites.

The following example shows how to switch from a Sprite Library Asset of color Sprites to another one containing identical Sprites but in grayscale:

1. First create visual variants of your actor's artwork. In this example, the original artwork is in color and a grayscale variant of it is created as an alternate Sprite set. Both should be saved to separate .psb files.
   <br/>
2. [Import](PreparingArtwork.md) both .psb files into the Unity Editor. Both become separate Model Prefabs in the Asset window.
   <br/>
3. [Create a Sprite Library Asset](SpriteSwapSetup.md) and assign each Sprite of the actor to a unique [Category](SLAsset.md#Category). It is suggested to name each Category and Label after the respective body part of the actor for convenience. Apply the changes once complete.<br/>![](images/2d-anim-slasset-swap-category-color.png)<br/>The Category and Label names for the parts of the color actor.
   <br/>
4. Repeat step 3 for the grayscale actor. Use the same Category and Label names for the corresponding gray Sprites.<br/>![](images/2d-anim-slasset-swap-category-gray.png)<br/>The grayscale Sprites with the same corresponding Category and Label names.
   <br/>
5. Drag the color Model Prefab into the Scene view, and go to the root GameObject. Add a [Sprite Library component](SLAsset.md#sprite-library-component) to the root GameObject and assign the color Sprite Library Asset created in step 3 to the **Sprite Library Asset** property.<br/>![](images/2d-anim-slasset-swap-step-5.png)
   <br/>
6. For every Sprite Renderer in the Instantiated Prefab, add a [Sprite Resolver component](SLAsset.md#sprite-resolver-component) and ensure that the Sprite Resolver component has the same Sprite selected as the Sprite Renderer.
   <br/>
7. With the Inspector window of the color Prefab root GameObject remaining open, go to the Asset window and assign the Sprite Library Asset created in step 4 to the **Sprite Library Asset** property of the Sprite Library component.
   <br/>
8. The Sprites of the color Prefab should have switched to their grayscale counterparts of the grayscale Sprite Library Asset.<br/>![](images/2d-anim-slasset-swap-step-8.png)<br/>The Sprite Library Asset property is set to the grayscale version of the original Sprite Library Asset and the actor's Sprites have switched accordingly.
