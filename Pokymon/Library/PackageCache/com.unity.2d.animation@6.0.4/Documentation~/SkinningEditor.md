# Skinning Editor

The __Skinning Editor__ is a module which is added to the [Sprite Editor](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SpriteEditor.html) after installing the 2D Animation package. Use the editor's [tools ](SkinEdToolsShortcuts.md) to create the [bones](SkinEdToolsShortcuts.html#bone-tools) of your actor's skeleton, generate and edit its mesh [geometry](SkinEdToolsShortcuts.html#geometry-tools), and adjust the [weights](SkinEdToolsShortcuts.html#weight-tools) that bind the bones to the meshes as you [rig your actor](CharacterRig.md).

## How to select a Sprite in the editor

Depending on the actor, there may be multiple Sprites in the Skinning Editor at once. Select specific Sprites in the Skinning Editor window in the following ways:

1. Double-click a Sprite to select it in the editor window. An orange outline and wireframe appears on the selected Sprite. The color of the outline color can be changed in [Tool Preferences](ToolPref.md).<br/>![](images/2d-anim-skinninged-select-sprite.png)
   <br/>
2. If the Sprite you want to select is behind other Sprites, hover the cursor over where the desired Sprite is, and double-click to cycle through all Sprites at the cursor location until you select the desired Sprite.<br/>![](images/2d-anim-skinninged-cycle-sprite.png)
